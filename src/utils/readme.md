# React Frontend Work Sample

## Introduction

I tried to design this problem to take a few hours at most, _but_ it's possible that we wildly miscalculated. Happy coding!


## Problem

Using our designs and the toolset of your choice, adapt and implement a single-page web application that will retrieve and display basic financial data for a stock ticker requested by the user.

The designs can be accessed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/EyV3tnyUtT9R1KHzNEE8Ol/Picwell-Work-Sample?node-id=0%3A1). You may need to create an account to access the style variables.


### Objectives

* Fetch the financial data for the user's ticker using a GET request
* Apply transformations to the data to be displayed
* Adapt the designs into components to display the information
* Provide instructions for how we can run and test your application


## Finance Data

The IEX Cloud API for the data we want to display is publically accessible at [this endpoint](https://sandbox.iexapis.com/stable/stock/aapl/quote?token=Tsk_678b4f8a0c3b4032b11c7568fb24dc17). The associated documentation for the endpoint is available [here](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/#quote).

The stock ticker `aapl` in the URL can be changed to a different ticker to get results for a different company.
